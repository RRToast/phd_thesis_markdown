@book{a_formal_analysis_of_authentication_in_the_tpm,
abstract = {In a previous FAST paper, I presented a quantitative model of the
process of trust building, and showed that trust is accumulated like wealth: the
rich get richer. This explained the pervasive phenomenon of adverse selection
of trust certificates, as well as the fragility of trust networks in general. But a
simple explanation does not always suggest a simple solution. It turns out that it
is impossible to alter the fragile distribution of trust without sacrificing some of
its fundamental functions. A solution for the vulnerability of trust must thus be
sought elsewhere, without tampering with its distribution. This observation was
the starting point of the present paper. It explores different methods for securing trust: not by redistributing, but by qualifying it. The methods used to break
privacy can be used to secure trust.},
